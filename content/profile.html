    My name is Stefan Popovski. Thank you for visiting my page.<br>
    I am a Mechanical Engineering international undergraduate at A. James Clark School of Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park. I come from Skopje, Macedonia, where I matriculated high school.
    Growing up I was always fascinated on the human dependence of energy, which grew into my curiosity of energy generation, especially nuclear power. Which is why I decided to study Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Nuclear Engineering
